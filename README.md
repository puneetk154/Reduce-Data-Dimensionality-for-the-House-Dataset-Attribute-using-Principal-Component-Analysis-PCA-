# Reduce-Data-Dimensionality-for-the-House-Dataset-Attribute-using-Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-
The purpose of this project is to develop a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model to reduce the number of random variables under consideration, by obtaining a set of principal variables. Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), reduce the data dimensions for the housing data attributes.
